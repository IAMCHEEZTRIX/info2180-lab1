      <h2>Damion Henry</h2>
      <p>
        I am a Computer Science student at the University of the West Indies,
        where I am developing a strong foundation in programming, software
        development, networking, and problem-solving. My studies have allowed me
        to explore both the theoretical and practical aspects of computing, from
        algorithms and data structures to real-world applications of technology.
        I enjoy tackling complex challenges, breaking them down into manageable
        parts, and finding innovative solutions. Beyond academics, I am
        passionate about leveraging technology to create impactful projects that
        can improve efficiency, enhance user experiences, and solve everyday
        problems.
